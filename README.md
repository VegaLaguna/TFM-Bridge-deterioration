# Model evaluation for Bridge deterioration using National Bridge Inventory Data


This repo will contain the notebooks developed while working on the TFM "Model evaluation for Bridge deterioration using National Bridge Inventory Data" on multi-girder steel and concrete bridges in cold climate zones of the USA.

Data comes from the opensource [FHWA (Federal Highway Administration) database](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/ascii.cfm)

Please check the attached [pdf report](https://github.com/VegaLaguna/TFM-Bridge-deterioration/blob/master/Model%20evaluation%20for%20Bridge%20deterioration%20using%20NBI.pdf) and the following Jupyter notebooks to read the study:


* [Part 1 - Analysis of NBI dataset](https://github.com/VegaLaguna/TFM-Bridge-deterioration/blob/master/01-Analysis_ALL18.ipynb)

* [Part 2 - Data Preparation](https://github.com/VegaLaguna/TFM-Bridge-deterioration/blob/master/02-Data_Merge_CLIM.ipynb)

* [Part 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/VegaLaguna/TFM-Bridge-deterioration/blob/master/03-EDA_CLIM.ipynb)

* [Part 4 - Model selection dataset](https://github.com/VegaLaguna/TFM-Bridge-deterioration/blob/master/04-Model_CLIM.ipynb)
